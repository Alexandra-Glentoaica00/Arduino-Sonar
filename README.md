**Components and supplies:** 1 Arduino UNO

1 Breadboard - 830 contacts

1 Feetech FS5106B  Servo-Motor

1 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor 

1 passive buzzer

jumper wires (as needed)

**Project Description** 
I built this sonar with a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor. I attached the latter to the motor using a bracket, so that with each movement of the motor, the sensor will rotate with it and we can calculate the distance to each object within its range.
If we detect an object less than half a metre away, then we will be warned audibly.
